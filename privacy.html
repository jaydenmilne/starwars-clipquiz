        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <h2>TL;DR All Your Base Are Belong To Us</h2>
        <p>This is a service running on a server in the US and subject to US law.</p>
        <p>If you send a GDPR request I will laugh derisively and go celebrate my freedom by shooting a watermelon or something.</p>
        <p>Anything you submit or do on this website is my data forever and I will do as I wish with it, including selling it to other properties, writing the next great American novel, and chanting it in a pagan ritual to please the Zucc. So be careful what you submit, assume it will live forever.</p>
        <p>That being said, this site is open source and you can see exactly what I persist, namely:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Score</li>
            <li>Difficulty</li>
            <li>Username you provide</li>
            <li>Timestamp</li>
        </ul>

        There also may be some HTTP logs where your IP address is logged. I also feed Big Brother by using Google Analytics.
